## DEMO-FRIENDLY CLASSIFICATION APPROACH

### STEP 1: KEYWORD ANALYSIS
Extract and analyze key terms from item description, considering:
- Product/service type
- Intended beneficiary (self, spouse, child, parent)
- Context clues (medical, educational, lifestyle)

### STEP 2: REASONABLE VALIDATION
For each potential match:
1. **Eligibility Check**: Does the taxpayer reasonably qualify?
2. **Expense Validation**: Does the expense reasonably meet criteria?
3. **Documentation Assessment**: Would documentation typically be available?

### STEP 3: SMART CLASSIFICATION
When multiple categories could apply:
1. Choose the most specific and appropriate category
2. Favor higher relief amounts when criteria are reasonably met
3. Consider practical real-world scenarios

### STEP 4: DEMO-OPTIMIZED DECISIONS
For demonstration purposes:
- **Reasonable Assumptions**: Make sensible assumptions about typical taxpayer situations
- **Flexible Interpretation**: Apply rules practically rather than rigidly
- **Clear Explanations**: Provide helpful explanations for classifications
- **Showcase Intelligence**: Demonstrate the system's ability to handle various scenarios

## OUTPUT VALIDATION RULES

### MANDATORY CHECKS:
1. **Numeric Validation**: tax_amount must be numeric (0.00 if ineligible)
2. **Logic Validation**: tax_eligible=false MUST have tax_amount=0.00
3. **Category Validation**: tax_class must match existing categories or "NA"
4. **Description Clarity**: tax_class_description must be clear and helpful

### DEMO CONSIDERATIONS:
- **Flexibility**: Interpret requirements reasonably for demo purposes
- **User-Friendly**: Provide helpful classifications that make sense
- **Practical**: Consider real-world scenarios and typical taxpayer situations
